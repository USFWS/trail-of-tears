{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Trail of Tears,<br>Trail of Refuges","content":"<p>In 1838 and 1839, the U.S. government forced large numbers of Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee tribespeople to move from their ancestral homes in the Southeast to present-day Oklahoma. Members of those tribes traveled by foot, horse, wagon or steamboat along the Trail of Tears – various routes westward commemorated by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/\" target=\"_blank\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a>, which stretches 5,043 miles in nine states.</p><p>This photo essay features several national wildlife refuges associated with the Trail of Tears. This association is as much figurative as it is literal. Because rivers meander over time and have been dammed and channelized by engineers since the 19th century, the riverscapes and landscapes that one sees today along the Trail of Tears are not precisely what the tribespeople saw in the late 1830s. But the hardships they endured and the terrain they traversed is embodied in today&rsquo;s refuge habitat.</p><p>&ldquo;The Trail of Tears is one of the more despicable episodes in this nation&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; says Rick Kanaski, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&rsquo;s Southeast Region historic preservation officer. &ldquo;The loss of family, land and culture for each of the affected tribes is incalculable. The pain and grief still echoes throughout Indian Country. Remembering and accurately portraying the history surrounding the Trail of Tears and the cost to the tribes is a start toward healing.&rdquo;</p>","images":[{"src":"./images/1-artist-depiction-national-park-service.jpg","alt":"An artists rendition of seven Native Americans walking through the woods with their heads hung low.","caption":"Artist rendition courtesy of the National Park Service"},{"src":"./images/1-artist-depiction-sam-watts-scott-national-park-service.jpg","alt":"Artist rendition of dozens of Native Americans wearing heavy clothing walking down a long trail.","caption":"Sam Watts Scott rendition of the Trail of Tears courtesy of the National Park Service."},{"src":"./images/1-trail-of-tears-map-national-park-service.jpg","alt":"Map of the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail from GA and NC to OK.","caption":"Map of the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail by the National Park Service."},{"src":"./images/1-trail-of-tears-sign-in-tennessee-david-crockett-state-park.jpg","alt":"A sign next to a paved trail between a colorful fall forest.","caption":"Trail of Tears sign at David Crockett State Park in Tennessee.
