        <p>In 1838 and 1839, the U.S. government forced large numbers of Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee tribespeople to move from their ancestral homes in the Southeast to present-day Oklahoma. Members of those tribes traveled by foot, horse, wagon or steamboat along the Trail of Tears – various routes westward commemorated by the 
        <a href="https://www.nps.gov/trte/" target="_blank">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a>, which stretches 5,043 miles in nine states.</p>
        <p>This photo essay features several national wildlife refuges associated with the Trail of Tears. This association is as much figurative as it is literal. Because rivers meander over time and have been dammed and channelized by engineers since the 19th century, the riverscapes and landscapes that one sees today along the Trail of Tears are not precisely what the tribespeople saw in the late 1830s. But the hardships they endured and the terrain they traversed is embodied in today’s refuge habitat.</p>
        <p>“The Trail of Tears is one of the more despicable episodes in this nation’s history,” says Rick Kanaski, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Southeast Region historic preservation officer. “The loss of family, land and culture for each of the affected tribes is incalculable. The pain and grief still echoes throughout Indian Country. Remembering and accurately portraying the history surrounding the Trail of Tears and the cost to the tribes is a start toward healing.”</p>

        <p>
        <strong>Today,</strong> 
        <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/wheeler/" target="_blank">Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge</a>, along the Tennessee River in northern Alabama, provides excellent habitat for native wildlife. A total of 300 species of birds, 47 species of mammals, 75 species of reptiles and amphibians, 115 species of fish, 38 species of freshwater mussels, and 26 species of freshwater snails have been documented on the refuge. It also annually supports Alabama’s largest concentration of wintering waterfowl (ducks and geese).</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In June 1838,</strong> two separate groups of emigrating Cherokees totaling about 1,500 people camped along the river within what is now the refuge. There is a kiosk commemorating the forced emigration at the refuge’s Flint Creek Day Use Area, which also features a 1.5-mile walking trail through an oak-hickory forest.</p>

        <strong>Today,</strong> 
        <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/tennessee/" target="_blank">Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge</a> stretches 65 miles along the Tennessee River and is rich in birds – 306 of the 409 bird species known to inhabit the state of Tennessee have been documented on the refuge.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In 1838-39,</strong> members of the Chickasaw, Muscogee and Cherokee tribes were transported via steamboat on the Tennessee River from Alabama northwest through what is now the refuge. There is no record of any of these steamboats stopping along the river in Tennessee for overnight camping. No known campsites or gravesites on the refuge are associated with the Trail of Tears. However, these records have not yet been fully researched.</p>

Researchers have catalogued 128 species of breeding songbirds, 49 species of mammals, 32 amphibians, 43 reptiles, 84 freshwater fish, 47 native mussels and 34 crustacean species at or near the refuge. Because of the region’s ecological significance, Cypress Creek Wetlands is a

        <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/lower_hatchie/" target="_blank">Lower Hatchie National Wildlife Refuges</a>, both along the Mississippi River in western Tennessee, provide food, water, shelter and space necessary for variety of birds and wildlife to survive. Chickasaw Refuge, named after one of the tribes forced to move, conserves 37,500 acres of bottomland hardwood and adjacent habitats for wintering waterfowl and migratory birds. Lower Hatchie Refuge, near the confluence of the Hatchie and Mississippi Rivers, conserves 13,960 acres of similar habitat for similar wildlife.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In 1838-39,</strong> forced emigres on one leg of the Trail of Tears passed what is now the refuge in or along east bank of the Mississippi. Specific tracts of land thought to be associated with the trail have been identified. But because of historical meandering of the river and the seasonal flooding on the river today, the landscape has changed, and there is little documentation. Still, today’s refuge habitat and vistas would be familiar to 19th-century tribespeople who traversed the trail.</p>

        <strong>Today,</strong> 
        <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/white_river/" target="_blank">Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge</a> lies mostly in the floodplain of the White River in eastern Arkansas. The river flows 93 miles through the refuge, which includes fertile bottomland hardwood forests and about 300 lakes interlaced with streams, sloughs and bayous. One result is habitat for numerous species of native wildlife and migratory birds. Another result is fabulous recreation for some 290,000 visitors annually.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In 1838-39,</strong> Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw and Cherokee tribespeople were transported along a section of the Military Road through what is now the refuge. The Military Road was built to connect Memphis and Little Rock. The road crossed the White River near the present-day community of Clarendon. During the removal period, one ferry transported travelers on the road across the White River and another carried travelers across nearby Rock Roe Bayou.</p>

In winter, it is not uncommon for the refuge to host up to 100,000 ducks and geese at once.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In 1838-39,</strong> the Arkansas River flowed through what is now an oxbow off the river’s main channel on the refuge. The refuge’s wildlife observation tower overlooks the Holla Bend oxbow, through which the Trail of Tears went. A sign commemorates the trail.</p>

        <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sequoyah/" target="_blank">Sequoyah National Wildlife Refuge</a>, in the foothills of the Ozark Mountain at the confluence of the Arkansas and Canadian Rivers in eastern Oklahoma, is seasonal home to tens of thousands of mallards, geese and other waterfowl as well as a diversity of mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians. The rivers, sloughs and oxbows provide feeding and spawning habitat for native sport fish. The watery landscape also supports pygmy rattlesnake and cottonmouth, red-eared slider turtles and alligator snapping turtles.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In 1838-39,</strong> as a panel exhibit at the refuge says, “More than 15,000 Cherokee began their trek west from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) over the Trail of Tears. They traveled by roads and rivers, including this stretch of the Arkansas River. Nearly 1,000 died during the journey westward, and up to 4,000 died as a result of the forced removal process.” Another part of the exhibit says: “Despite the hardships of their journeys, members of the five removed tribes established new lives in the West. They stand as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century.”</p>

        <strong>Today,</strong> 
        <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/egmont_key/" target="_blank">Egmont Key National Wildlife Refuge</a>, at the mouth of Tampa Bay on Florida’s west coast, supports more than 117 species of nesting, migratory and wintering birds. It also provides nesting habit for threatened Atlantic loggerhead sea turtles and for a large population of gopher tortoises and box turtles.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>In the mid-1800s,</strong> Egmont Key was the site of the forced removal of Seminole tribespeople. The route followed the Gulf of Mexico coast up to Florida’s panhandle, went over towards New Orleans, progressed up the Mississippi River, connected with the main trail at the Arkansas River and continued to Fort Gibson in Oklahoma. The last trip was in 1858, when Seminole Chief Billy Bowlegs and about 160 individuals left Egmont Key aboard the Grey Cloud, a steamboat.</p>
