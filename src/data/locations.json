    "content": "<p>In 1838 and 1839, the U.S. government forced large numbers of Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee tribespeople to move from their ancestral homes in the Southeast to present-day Oklahoma. Members of those tribes traveled by foot, horse, wagon or steamboat along the Trail of Tears – various routes westward commemorated by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/\" target=\"_blank\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a>, which stretches 5,043 miles in nine states.</p><p>This photo essay features several national wildlife refuges associated with the Trail of Tears. This association is as much figurative as it is literal. Because rivers meander over time and have been dammed and channelized by engineers since the 19th century, the riverscapes and landscapes that one sees today along the Trail of Tears are not precisely what the tribespeople saw in the late 1830s. But the hardships they endured and the terrain they traversed is embodied in today&rsquo;s refuge habitat.</p><p>&ldquo;The Trail of Tears is one of the more despicable episodes in this nation&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; says Rick Kanaski, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&rsquo;s Southeast Region historic preservation officer. &ldquo;The loss of family, land and culture for each of the affected tribes is incalculable. The pain and grief still echoes throughout Indian Country. Remembering and accurately portraying the history surrounding the Trail of Tears and the cost to the tribes is a start toward healing.&rduo;</p>",

A total of 300 species of birds, 47 species of mammals, 75 species of reptiles and amphibians, 115 species of fish, 38 species of freshwater mussels, and 26 species of freshwater snails have been documented on the refuge. It also annually supports Alabama’s largest concentration of wintering waterfowl (ducks and geese).</p><p><strong>In June 1838,</strong> two separate groups of emigrating Cherokees totaling about 1,500 people camped along the river within what is now the refuge. There is a kiosk commemorating the forced emigration at the refuge’s Flint Creek Day Use Area, which also features a 1.5-mile walking trail through an oak-hickory forest.</p>",

There is no record of any of these steamboats stopping along the river in Tennessee for overnight camping. No known campsites or gravesites on the refuge are associated with the Trail of Tears. However, these records have not yet been fully researched.</p>",

Chickasaw Refuge, named after one of the tribes forced to move, conserves 37,500 acres of bottomland hardwood and adjacent habitats for wintering waterfowl and migratory birds. Lower Hatchie Refuge, near the confluence of the Hatchie and Mississippi Rivers, conserves 13,960 acres of similar habitat for similar wildlife.</p><p><strong>In 1838-39,</strong> forced emigres on one leg of the Trail of Tears passed what is now the refuge in or along east bank of the Mississippi. Specific tracts of land thought to be associated with the trail have been identified. But because of historical meandering of the river and the seasonal flooding on the river today, the landscape has changed, and there is little documentation. Still, today’s refuge habitat and vistas would be familiar to 19th-century tribespeople who traversed the trail. </p>",

One result is habitat for numerous species of native wildlife and migratory birds. Another result is fabulous recreation for some 290,000 visitors annually.</p><p><strong>In 1838-39,</strong> Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw and Cherokee tribespeople were transported along a section of the Military Road through what is now the refuge. The Military Road was built to connect Memphis and Little Rock. The road crossed the White River near the present-day community of Clarendon. During the removal period, one ferry transported travelers on the road across the White River and another carried travelers across nearby Rock Roe Bayou.</p>",

The watery landscape also supports pygmy rattlesnake and cottonmouth, red-eared slider turtles and alligator snapping turtles.</p><p><strong>In 1838-39,</strong> as a panel exhibit at the refuge says, “More than 15,000 Cherokee began their trek west from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) over the Trail of Tears. They traveled by roads and rivers, including this stretch of the Arkansas River. Nearly 1,000 died during the journey westward, and up to 4,000 died as a result of the forced removal process.” Another part of the exhibit says: “Despite the hardships of their journeys, members of the five removed tribes established new lives in the West. They stand as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century.”</p>",

The route followed the Gulf of Mexico coast up to Florida’s panhandle, went over towards New Orleans, progressed up the Mississippi River, connected with the main trail at the Arkansas River and continued to Fort Gibson in Oklahoma. The last trip was in 1858, when Seminole Chief Billy Bowlegs and about 160 individuals left Egmont Key aboard the Grey Cloud, a steamboat.</p>",
